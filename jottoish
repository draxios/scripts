 ASP.NET Core MVC project with Entity Framework Core

### Step 1: Setting up the Database Context

1. Create a folder named `Models` in your project root.
2. Inside the `Models` folder, add the classes `Game.cs`, `Player.cs`, and `GamePlayer.cs` with the content from the previous example.
3. Add a new class named `AppDbContext.cs` in the root of your project or within a `Data` folder.

```csharp
// AppDbContext.cs

using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Stifel.Games.Feral.Models;

namespace Stifel.Games.Feral.Data
{
    public class AppDbContext : DbContext
    {
        public AppDbContext(DbContextOptions<AppDbContext> options) : base(options) { }

        public DbSet<Game> Games { get; set; }
        public DbSet<Player> Players { get; set; }
        public DbSet<GamePlayer> GamePlayers { get; set; }

        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            modelBuilder.Entity<GamePlayer>()
                .HasKey(gp => new { gp.GameId, gp.PlayerId });
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Configure the Database

Modify your `appsettings.json` to add a connection string:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "YourConnectionStringHere"
  },
  // ... other settings
}
```

Register the context and the database provider in `Startup.cs`:

```csharp
using Stifel.Games.Feral.Data;

// ...

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options =>
        options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
    
    // ... other services
}
```

### Step 3: Implement Game Logic

1. Create a new folder named `Services`.
2. Inside `Services`, create a new interface named `IWordService.cs` and a class named `WordService.cs`.

```csharp
// IWordService.cs

namespace Stifel.Games.Feral.Services
{
    public interface IWordService
    {
        string GetRandomWord();
    }
}

// WordService.cs

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace Stifel.Games.Feral.Services
{
    public class WordService : IWordService
    {
        private readonly List<string> _words = new List<string> 
        {
            "apple", "grape", "cherry", "orange", "melon"
            // Add as many words as you need
        };

        public string GetRandomWord()
        {
            var random = new Random();
            int index = random.Next(_words.Count);
            return _words[index];
        }
    }
}
```

3. Register the service in `Startup.cs`:

```csharp
using Stifel.Games.Feral.Services;

// ...

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // ... previous code

    services.AddTransient<IWordService, WordService>();
}
```

### Step 4: Implementing Controllers and Views

1. Right-click on the `Controllers` folder -> Add -> Controller.
2. Choose "MVC Controller - Empty" and name it `GameController`.
3. Implement game logic within the controller using the previous example as a guideline.
4. Add corresponding views within the `Views` folder. Remember to structure the folder hierarchy to match controllers (`Views/Game/StartGame.cshtml`, etc.)

### Step 5: Running Migrations

To create the database schema, you'll need to run migrations. Open the terminal or package manager console and run:

```
dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration
dotnet ef database update
```

### Step 6: Running the Game

Run your application. Navigate to the `/Game/StartGame` URL to start a game. Make sure you've implemented the necessary views and updated the controller to handle game logic as described earlier.

### 1. Database Connection String & Local Database:

If you are planning to run the database locally (which is suitable for development), you can use SQL Server LocalDB, a lightweight version of SQL Server that runs as a service. Here's what you need to do:

#### 1.1. Ensure LocalDB is Installed:

If you've installed Visual Studio with the .NET Desktop Development workload, you should have LocalDB already. Otherwise, you can install it with the SQL Server Express installer. 

#### 1.2. Set the Connection String:

In `appsettings.json`, you can set the connection string for LocalDB like this:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=FeralGameDb;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
  },
  // ... other settings
}
```

This connection string points to the local SQL Server LocalDB instance and specifies a new database called `FeralGameDb`.

### 2. Configuration in `.NET 6.0` (`Program.cs` instead of `Startup.cs`):

In .NET 6, the `Startup.cs` class was replaced with a more concise application setup in `Program.cs`. This new setup is called the minimal API design. Your `Program.cs` likely has code for building the web host, adding services, and setting up endpoints.

Here's how you'd modify the `Program.cs` to set up the database context and services:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// ...

builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

builder.Services.AddTransient<IWordService, WordService>();

// ...

var app = builder.Build();
```

In the above code:
- We added services to the service collection just as we would have in the `Startup.cs` in earlier versions.
- `builder.Configuration` replaces the need for the `IConfiguration` object we would've pulled from the `Startup.cs` constructor. 

With these changes, you can continue with the remaining steps.

Remember, after setting the connection string and configuring the services, don't forget to run the migrations to create the database schema, as mentioned in Step 5.
