Example of how you can specify a service account for a particular pipeline task by adding a demand:

steps:
- task: PowerShell@2 
  demands:
   - Agent.UserName: somedomain\serviceaccount 
  inputs:
   targetType: inline
   script: |
    # PowerShell script code here
  env:
   # Reference service account password from variable group   
   SERVICE_PASS: $(service-pass)
The key parts:

Add a demands section under the task and specify Agent.UserName equal to the service account username
Reference the service account password through an environment variable mapped to your variable group
When the pipeline runs, it will allocate an agent that is running as that service account username for just that task
Your PowerShell script can then use the SERVICE_PASS environment variable to authenticate with the credentials needed for that service account
This allows you to isolate the elevated permissions needed for that task to just a single agent allocation. The rest of the pipeline will run as the default agent service account.
